# Hello and welcome to ramp up!

The purpose of this document is to walk you through and give you an understanding of the things we do here on EVT's telemetry database team.

By the end of rampup you will:
1. Create a new React project.
2. Gain an understanding of basic front-end development (very basic).
3. Connect a front-end application to back-end logic.
4. Implement a RestAPI to standardize interactions between front and back-end components.
5. Dissect .MF4 files using .DBC files (Don't worry I don't know what they stand for either)
6. Manipulate data from Controller Area Network (CAN) messages (it is less scary than it sounds I promise)

This is a basic idea of the things we do here and after you have completed the tasks described below you should be ready for anything the DB team throws at you.<br>
Or at least equally as ready as anyone else...
